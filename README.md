# ASHMC_SP19_Notifications
Emails each president of every Associated Students of Harvey Mudd College (ASHMC) club, notifying them how much money their club has remaining this school year.

This is the second time I am making a repo for this, since the first time I included my personal credentials on a commit :/

Simply run current_budget_notifications.py to send the emails.  Be sure to put in your own Gmail credentials, and put in your own test emails in example.csv.

If you have any questions, concerns, comments, or suggestions, please feel free to reach out to me at mmaleno@hmc.edu and/or maxwellmaleno@hotmail.com.  Enjoy!
